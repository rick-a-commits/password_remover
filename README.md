This code performs several tasks related to handling password-protected Excel files.

First, it specifies the path of the folder that contains the password-protected Excel files and the path of the folder where the modified Excel files will be saved.

Then, it creates an Excel application object and iterates through each file in the specified folder. For each file, it attempts to open it using the specified password. If the file cannot be opened, an error message is printed and the code moves on to the next file.

If the file is successfully opened, a new workbook is created to save the modified Excel file. The code then iterates through each sheet in the original workbook and copies its content to the new workbook.

The modified Excel file is saved in the output folder with a modified name, and the original and new workbooks are closed. If there is an error during the saving process, an error message is printed.

After processing all the files in the folder, the Excel application is closed.

Next, the code gets all the file names in the folder and iterates through each file to delete them. If a file is successfully deleted, a success message is printed.

Then, the code uses the shutil library to move the modified Excel files from the output folder to a new folder with the original file name.

Next, the code organizes the files in the new folder into different subfolders based on their file names. Files containing "Import_Header_" in their names are moved to the "Header" subfolder, files containing "Import_Item_" in their names are moved to the "Item" subfolder, and files containing "Export_Item" in their names are moved to the "Exports" subfolder.

After that, the code uses the glob library to get the file paths of all files in the "Exports" subfolder. It then reads the Excel files and combines their data into a single dataframe. The combined dataframe is saved as an Excel file in the specified output path.

Finally, the code deletes all the files in the "Exports" subfolder.

Overall, this code automates the process of removing passwords from Excel files, organizing them into different subfolders, combining their data, and saving the combined data as a new Excel file.
